# CS50P : Introduction to Programming with Python

Welcome to my repository for CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python. This repository contains all the problem sets, assignments, and projects I completed as part of the course.

## Course Overview

CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python is a comprehensive course designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of programming using Python. The course covers topics such as:

- Functions, Variables
- Conditionals
- Loops

- Libraries
- Unit Tests
- File I/O
- Regular Expressions
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Et Cetera

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `pset0` to `pset8`: Problem sets containing various exercises and coding challenges.
- `projects`: Larger projects demonstrating the application of course concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Mummanajagadeesh/CS50P.git
    cd CS50P
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

You can run the Python scripts directly from the command line. For example, to run a script from `pset0`:

```sh
python pset0/script_name.py
